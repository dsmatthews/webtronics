# Status #

I'm testing a new repository on github where I have other software. Google has been a great host.My new updates will be there for now and eventually I may delete this one.

Lately I have slacked off on browser compatibility testing.I will always test in firefox,sometimes chrome, and seldom internet explorer.

The code is javascript based on Richdraw. It can save and open svg files. It has a small part library. It has a chip maker that makes rectangles with up to 200 pins. If you want to download Webtronics please use Subversion to get the latest version.

I was hoping for a few volunteers and more community involvement. If you would like to contribute, you can do so by opening issues for bugs, helping me solve open issues or just suggesting improvements. Webtronics is almost out of alpha phase. Which means I have decided on the core features. You might be able to add your name to the list of contributors.
